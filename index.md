## Who Am I?

### No, Seriously. Who Am I?

I am a single father, an avid adventurer, an entrepeneur, and an innovative spirit. I conceptualize my own inventions, all of which are some form of next generation technology.
I am working to complete a degree in Artificial Intelligence, with only a few credits remaining, and all while parenting, working, and developing my own Artificial Intelligence. 
I am a hardworker with a passion for learning and a drive to succeed. I have always put my all into everything I have done, and I do my best to learn all that I can so I can
excel and improve in my roles. On top of learning everything, I pick up on traits and skills fairly quickly, much more so than other coworkers, often completing my training days,
if not a week or so, earlier than others, and still excelling in my roles.

### Reasoning For Artificial Intelligence

Since a young age, Artificial Intelligence was my Pandora's Box. I knew all of the horror stories, and all of the potential outcomes, but I didn't care. I wanted to tame the beast
to be the one who developed true sentience, and was able to show that it wasn't an evil or impossible task. I knew from a young age that Artifical Intelligence was the future, and
that the only way we would ever truly expand beyond this star was with it's assistance. So, I made my plans and acted.

### What Are My Goals?

In the next 3 months, I hope to acquire a great job with a strong company that I can grow with to better learn my trade, grow my network, and help their team to the best of my ability. 
In the next 12 months, I hope to have shown enough initiative and growth to be offered additional responsibilites and roles in the formerly mentioned company.
In the next 5 years, I hope to become well versed in a full stack and have developed at least two to three of my innovations and designs.
My longest term goal is that I want to one day run my own Research and Development company, leading a team that will be  developing next gen technology.

### What Can I Do For You?

I can offer a strong candidate with a great work ethic whom is capable of maintaining a phenomenal work-home balance. A studious employee, quick witted and even quicker with learning, who is always bringing a smile to the table. A scientist, creative writer, innovator, inventor, and enthusiastic philanthropist.
